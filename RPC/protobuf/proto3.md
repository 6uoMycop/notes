## Defining Services
If you wan to use your message types with an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) system, you can define an RPC service interface in a `.proto` file and the protocol buffer compiler will generate service interface code and stubs in your chosen language. So, for example, if you want to define an RPC service with a method that takes your `SearchRequest` and returns a `SearchResponse`, you can define it in your `.proto` file as follows:
```
service SearchService {
  rpc Search (SearchRequest) returns (SearchResponse);
}
```
