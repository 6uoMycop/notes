## x86 Assembly Guide

### Registers

Modern (i.e 386 and beyond) x86 processors have eight 32-bit general purpose registers. The register names are mostly historical. For example, `EAX` used to be called the accumulator since it was used by a number of arithmetic operations, and `ECX` was known as the counter since it was used to hold a loop index. Whereas most of the registers have lost their special purposes in the modern instruction set, by convention, two are reserved for special purposes â€” the stack pointer (`ESP`) and the base pointer (`EBP`).

### Memory and Addressing Modes
#### Addressing Memory
Here we illustrate some examples using the `mov` instruction that moves data between registers and memory. This instruction has two operands: the first is the destination and the second specifies the source.

Some examples of `mov` instructions using address computations are:
```
mov ebp, esp    ; Move the contents of the esp register into the ebp register.
```
### Instructions
#### Data Movement Instructions
- `mov`
  
  The `mov` instruction copies the data item referred to by its second operand (i.e. register contents, memory contents, or a constant value) into the location referred to by its first operand (i.e. a register or memory). While register-to-register moves are possible, direct memory-to-memory moves are not. In cases where memory transfers are desired, the source memory contents must first be loaded into a register, then can be stored to the destination memory address.

- `push`
  
  The `push` instruction places its operand onto the top of the hardware supported stack in memory. Specifically, `push` first decrements ESP by 4, then places its operand into the contents of the 32-bit location at address [ESP]. ESP (the stack pointer) is decremented by push since the x86 stack grows down - i.e. the stack grows from high addresses to lower addresses.

#### Control Flow Instructions
The x86 processor maintains an instruction pointer (IP) register that is a 32-bit value indicating the location in memory where the current instruction starts. Normally, it increments to point to the next instruction in memory begins after execution an instruction.

We use the notation `<label>` to refer to labeled locations in the program text. Labels can be inserted anywhere in x86 assembly code text by entering a label name followed by a colon. For example,
```
       mov esi, [ebp+8]
begin: xor ecx, ecx
       mov eax, [esi]
```
The second instruction in this code fragment is labeled `begin`. Elsewhere in the code, we can refer to the memory location that this instruction is located at in memory using the more convenient symbolic name `begin`. This label is just a convenient way of expressing the location instead of its 32-bit value.

- `jmp`
  
  Transfers program control flow to the instruction at the memory location indicated by the operand.

- `call`
  The `call` instruction first pushes the current code location onto the hardware supported stack in memory, and then performs an unconditional jump to the code location indicated by the label operand. Unlike the simple jump instructions, the `call` instruction saves the location to return to when the subroutine completes.

### Calling Convention
The C calling convention is based heavily on the use of the hardware-supported stack. It is based on the `push`, `pop`, `call`, and `ret` instructions. Subroutine parameters are passed on the stack. Registers are saved on the stack, and local variables used by subroutines are placed in memory on the stack.

The calling convention is broken into two sets of rules. The first set of rules is employed by the caller of the subroutine, and the second set of rules is observed by the writer of the subroutine (the callee).

A good way to visualize the operation of the calling convention is to draw the contents of the nearby region of the stack during subroutine execution. The image above depicts the contents of the stack during the execution of a subroutine with three parameters and three local variables. The cells depicted in the stack are 32-bit wide memory locations, thus the memory addresses of the cells are 4 bytes apart. The first parameter resides at an offset of 8 bytes from the base pointer. Above the parameters on the stack (and below the base pointer), the `call` instruction placed the return address, thus leading to an extra 4 bytes of offset from the base pointer to the first parameter. When the `ret` instruction is used to return from the subroutine, it will jump to the return address stored on the stack.

#### Caller Rules
To make a subrouting call, the caller should:

1. Before calling a subroutine, the caller should save the contents of certain registers that are designated *caller-saved*. The caller-saved registers are EAX, ECX, EDX. Since the called subroutine is allowed to modify these registers, if the caller relies on their values after the subroutine returns, the caller must push the values in these registers onto the stack (so they can be restore after the subroutine returns.

2. To pass parameters to the subroutine, push them onto the stack before the call. The parameters should be pushed in inverted order (i.e. last parameter first). Since the stack grows down, the first parameter will be stored at the lowest address.

3. To call the subroutine, use the `call` instruction. This instruction places the return address on top of the parameters on the stack (i.e. the EIP of the instruction to execute after the call returns is pushed on the stack), and branches to the subroutine code. This invokes the subroutine, which should follow the callee rules below.

After the subroutine returns (immediately following the `call` instruction), the caller can expect to find the return value of the subroutine in the register EAX. To restore the machine state, the caller should:

1. Remove the parameters from stack. This restores the stack to its state before the call was performed.

2. Restore the contents of caller-saved registers (EAX, ECX, EDX) by popping them off of the stack. The caller can assume that no other registers were modified by the subroutine.

#### Callee Rules
The definition of the subroutine should adhere to the following rules at the beginning of the subroutine:

1. Push the value of EBP onto the stack, and then copy the value of ESP into EBP using the following instructions:
   ```
   push ebp
   mov  ebp, esp
   ```
   This initial action maintains the *base pointer*, EBP. The base pointer is used by convention as a point of reference for finding parameters and local variables on the stack. When a subroutine is executing, the base pointer holds a copy of the stack pointer value from when the subroutine started executing. Parameters and local variables will always be located at known, constant offsets away from the base pointer value. We push the old base pointer value at the beginning of the subroutine so that we can later restore the appropriate base pointer value for the caller when the subroutine returns.

2. Next, allocate local variables by making space on the stack. Recall, the stack grows down, so to make space on the top of the stack, the stack pointer should be decremented. The amount by which the stack pointer is decremented depends on the number and size of local variables needed. For example, if 3 local integers (4 bytes each) were required, the stack pointer would need to be decremented by 12 to make space for these local variables (i.e., `sub esp, 12`).

3. Next, save the values of the *callee-saved* registers that will be used by the function. To save registers, push them onto the stack. The callee-saved registers are EBX, EDI, and ESI.

After these three actions are performed, the body of the subroutine may proceed. When the subroutine is returns, it must follow these steps:

1. Leave the return value in EAX.

2. Restore the old values of any callee-saved registers (EDI and ESI) that were modified. The register contents are restored by popping them from the stack. The registers should be popped in the inverse order that they were pushed.

3. Deallocate local variables. In practice, a less error-prone way to deallocate the variables is to move the value in the base pointer into the stack pointer: mov esp, ebp. This works because the base pointer always contains the value that the stack pointer contained immediately prior to the allocation of the local variables.

4. Immediately before returning, restore the caller's base pointer value by popping EBP off the stack.

4. Finally, return to the caller by executing a `ret` instruction. This instruction will find and remove the appropriate return address from the stack.

Note that after the call returns, the caller cleans up the stack using the `add` instruction. We have 12 bytes (3 parameters * 4 bytes each) on the stack, and the stack grows down. Thus, to get rid of the parameters, we can simply add 12 to the stack pointer.
