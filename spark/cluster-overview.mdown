# Cluster Manager Types
The system currently supports three cluster managers:

- Standalone – a simple cluster manager included with Spark that makes it easy to set up a cluster.
- Apache Mesos – a general cluster manager that can also run Hadoop MapReduce and service applications.
- Hadoop YARN – the resource manager in Hadoop 2.
