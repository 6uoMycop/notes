== Generate SSH key-pair ==
If you do not have generated a private-public key pair, you can do so bby typing the following command to your terminal:
{{{
ssh-keygen
}}}
It will most likely generate an RSA key in your home folder (`~/.ssh/`). The content of `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` is the
public key that we ask you to mail us when we create an ANT account for you.

== Tunnelling   ==

Alternatively you can create a transparent ssh tunnel and use queen to proxy connections.  This tunnel can then be used to proxy all traffic or selected portions through queen.  
For example, in combination with browser proxy plugins such as chrome's proxy-switchysharp or firefox foxy-proxy, you can direct only requests for *.ant-net to queen. 

'''Note''' that this is more efficient than the `sshuttle` method described below, and is the '''preferred''' method.



''Hint:'' In order to work also within the testbed properly, please set the following ~/.ssh/config (permissions: 644) on your machine:

{{{
NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost yes
ForwardAgent yes

Host queen
	User <YOUR USERNAME ON QUEEN>
	Port 22
	HostName queen.nlehd.de
	ForwardX11 yes

Host queen-tunnel
	User <YOUR USERNAME ON QUEEN>
	Port 22
	HostName queen.nlehd.de
	LocalForward 8000 localhost:8123
	RequestTTY no
	ExitOnForwardFailure yes
	ControlMaster auto
	ControlPath ~/.ssh/cm_sockets/%r@%h:%p
	Compression yes
	CompressionLevel 6
	KeepAlive yes
	Stricthostkeychecking no

Host repos repos.ant-net
	ProxyCommand ssh queen nc -q0 %h %p

Host c??? uc???
	User root
	ForwardX11 yes
	StrictHostKeyChecking no
	UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
	ProxyCommand ssh queen nc -q0 %h %p
}}}

Now create the necessary configs 
{{{
mkdir ~/.ssh/cm_sockets
}}}

Add the following tunnel aliases to your shell  (e.g.  `~/.bash_aliases` or `~/.bashrc` ) 
{{{
# start a tunnel 
alias qtunnel='ssh -f -N queen-tunnel && echo "Connected."'

# check if tunnel is up 
alias qtunnelc='ssh -O check queen-tunnel '

# disconnect tunnel 
alias qtunnelx='ssh -O exit queen-tunnel && echo "Disconnected."'

}}}



=== Example usage: ===
 
Config browser to forward  connection to *.ant-net to queen.  With chrome, we use
[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proxy-switchysharp/dpplabbmogkhghncfbfdeeokoefdjegm?hl=en  SwitchySharp]. 
Be sure to start your tunnel, before connecting to ant machines, and if nothing is working, check your tunnel is up `qtunnelc`.

{{{
mahmed@ria:~ $ qtunnel
Connected.

mahmed@ria:~ $ qtunnelc
Master running (pid=17878)

mahmed@ria:~ $ qtunnelx
Exit request sent.
Disconnected.
mahmed@ria:~ $
}}}
